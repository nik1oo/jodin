Everything you need to know about the Odin language can be found in one place at the [Overview page of the Odin website](http://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/). To browse the packages that come pre-installed with Odin you can go the [Packages page](https://pkg.odin-lang.org/).

In the `examples` folder of Jodin you can find a notebook titled `demo.ipynb` which contains the Odin demo in notebook format. You can execute all the examples one-by-one and play around with them.
